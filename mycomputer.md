## Commentary
### My Relationship
My relationship with this specific computer is very interesting. I bought it after I broke my old computer after I downloaded a virus that slowed the entire computer down for ages, then it fell several times. I quite like this computer. It was originally a custom computer for some guy who had it's processor (I think) changed. The guy at the store gave it to us for a much lower price because it'd been much harder to sell after being abandoned. I don't know much about the technology on the computer but it can run safari and chrome at the same time and that's more than enough for me.
### Hardware Configuration
My computer slows down when I have too many things open/running at once. The fan also turns on and it gets very hot. This is because the RAM is overloaded with information, and the information is moved to the SSD or hard disk, making it harder and more time consuming to access. Another thing is when I have programs that use a lot of CPU (like maleware bytes) downloaded, the computer also slows down and the fan turns on. This is because there is so much CPU being used by the programs that processing takes longer than usual.
